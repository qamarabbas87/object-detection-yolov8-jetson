This project is an initial step for beginner learners in the field of Embedded AI.

This project shoiws the potential of Yolo based realtime object detection using opencv in Python.

code files are easy to run using command prompt.

Just go the project directory and run using command "python_filename_to_run.py"
and Enter

Wait a moment, your laptop webcam output will be shown with object-detection with boxes labelling the object names.

Yahooo, you have run your first yolov8 on your desktop or laptop.

It is a begiinning to the world of fantastic AI, your journey started with my code. 

Share my project link to other learners to start the this great journey of learning and exploring AI.

Thank!
